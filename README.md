# next-users-dashboard

This dashboard was created as a part of my react/nextJS earning due to some technical improvements

First, install all the dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

## Getting Started

Run the databases and development server

```bash
npx json-server-auth auth-db.json --port 4000
```

```bash
npx json-server --watch db.json --port 3003
```

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
